                <h1>What are Arachfara?</h1>
                <p>Arachfara or Arachs for short are the inhabitants of Planet Astras. They are an Anthropomorphic species surviving on a dangerous planet. Their looks resemble a mix of earth like animals with a hint of mystery. Whether it be the spider like legs coming from their back or the mouth that always seems to smile at you.</p>
                
                <h2>Biological Features</h2>
                <p>The Arachs have no concept of gender. The species overall being completely genderless and not reproducing the "traditional way". More on that later. They do not have any teeth, but the sharp corners on their mouth are bone behind an hard cartilage covered in short fur. Their saliva and the enzymes in their mouth let them produce a spider silk like substance. This can be used for traps, clothing, hammocks and more. The spider like appendages are made out of chitin to be sturdy, yet have some flexibility. If broken off they will regrow with each shed (Only the appendages shed every other month or so). Their hands resemble claw like fingers. Huge hands on a way too long looking thin arm. Their legs strong, build for climbing, running, jumping. The dense fur on their neck protects them from other creatures trying to kill them. Arachs posses the ability to walk on all fours. But they usually will only do that to hunt or sneak. They have full control over the appendages on their back.</p>
                
                <h2>Diet</h2>
                <p>Arachfara are omnivores. They eat meat as well as plants and berries. Depending on their region the diet might also include minerals or even cannibalism.</p>
                
                <h2>Reproduction</h2>
                <p>As they are genderless and do not posses any genitalia they are created with a form of magical event. This is different between the regions. Some regions have flowers that only bloom under certain circumstances. Other regions have crystals being melted by the sun into an Arach. Due to this, hybrids are not possible. Not between Arachfara and other species, nor between the different region variants.</p>

                <h1>Shining Ones | Open Wilds</h1>
                <p class="region-intro">The Open Wilds are one of the 2 most livable regions on Astras. Here we have open fields, beautiful flower areas and small but comfortable caves. Not as many predators are here and many food sources can be found. The temperatures are similar to earth with seasons like ours.</p>
                
                <h2>Food Sources</h2>
                <p>Many different berries and plants can be found and grown here. Agriculture is big in the Open Wilds to sustain even the biggest of clans. Many creatures that are similar to our mammals can be found here and will be hunted if the Arachs have a chance to.</p>
                
                <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
                <p>As it is relatively safe in this area Arachs of all colors can be seen. More common are light browns or greens but also greys and reds are seen. They always seem to be wearing a mask to help with the glare of the sun as there are not that many caves around to hide in. To help with spotting prey or predators they have heat sensing pits on their snout, though they usually are mostly hidden under fur.</p>
                
                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>In the open wilds rarely a beautiful flower can be found. In the right season and at the right time, this flower will bloom and glow brightly. If a feather or fur piece is taken and put into the flower at that time, an Arach will be created. As this only happens every couple decades the population doesn't outgrow the space of the Open Wilds.</p>
                
                <h2>Clans</h2>
                <p>Clans are the biggest in this region featuring up to 35 to 40 members. Here aren't as many clans but rather big ones.</p>

                <h1>Stonecrawler | Stone Desert</h1>
                <p class="region-intro">The Stone Desert is similar to a wasteland. Instead of sand, this region is covered in rounded rocks and minerals. Most creatures here are similar to snakes and insects from earth. During the day it becomes up to 60°C hot which makes most creatures stay hidden. Once the night comes and temperatures sink to comfortable 5°C, the critters and Arachs come out of their hides to eat. Some oasis like areas will have some green due to the water. Moss and succulent like plants will grow near it while little bushes and shrubs will grow further away. The moss and other plants near the Oasis can be strong enough to craft rope from. The exposed minerals and rocks make for good crafting materials on the spot.</p>
                <h2>Food Sources</h2>
                <p>As food the most available option are the insects as they are high in calcium and protein. Especially grubs and larva are a delicacy here with added minerals for taste. Other than that the moss and most plants are edible as well, yet not as nutritious. The snake like creatures are inedible for Arachs due to enzymes in their flesh. If an Arach were to eat them they would start vomiting immedietly which dehydrates them. The chances of dying by dehydration are very high in the Stone Desert.</p>
                
                <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
                <p>The fur colors here range from dark reds to warm greys. Usually the Arachs are a bit lighter to reflect the light and heat during the day. Some Arachs will be a bit darker here. Very bright colors are usually a death sentence as they will attract flesh eating insects as well as other predators.</p>
                
                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>The Arachs in the Stone desert are created with the Sunflare Crystal. During the night an Arach will burrow out a little dent in the ground. In there, they will place the crystal and quickly hide before the sun rises. At the middle of the day the sun will hit the crystal perfectly and it reflects the rays of the sun. The bright light will then have enough energy to create a youngling. The original Arach that placed the crystal now needs to be quick and gently burry the youngling under the stones of the desert to protect them from the heat. At this point, the adult usually dies from heatstroke and disintegrates into the ground. At night youngling can crawl out of the ground and find other Arachs or a cave nearby.</p>
                
                <h2>Clans</h2>
                <p>Clans are common in the stone desert. Despite it being a dangerous place to live at during the day, the nights are quite comfortable and productive. The size of a clan usually is between 5 and 15 members.</p>

                <h1>Icefang | Snowy Abyss</h1>
                <p class="region-intro">The Snowy Abyss is located in a deep icy cavern on top of the mountain region. The temperatures are constantly below freezing and oxygen is limited which allows barely any Life to sprout up there aside from the gigantic Pervivanimus. The Pervivanimus or short Perviva is a dark tree that is dead and spongy on the inside. The sap runing through the hollow sponge canals seems resistent to the harsh environment. On the outside it appears almost like charcoal in color but like stone in strength. The pine needles are like glass and dangerous for anyone underneath it. In the Snowy Abyss are no flat plateaus or areas to comfortably live on.</p>
            
                <h2>Surviving in the cold</h2>
                <p>The spongy inside of the Perviva is edible though not described as particularly tasty. The sprouts of the Perviva are also edible. A little sweeter in taste and very nutritious. Due to the cold most water sources are frozen. The only way the Icefangs can stay hydrated is through the food they consume. The sap of the Pervivanimus is high in electrolytes and water. It’s taste is best described as a very sour tasting pickle. Aside from the Perviva other critters can survive in the Snowy Abyss. A mouse like creature eating through the snow and ice, teeth strong as diamond to even carve into the bark of Pervivanimus trees. While difficult to catch their meat contains a high protein and fat content, perfect especially for the younglings. Some other bugs and critters are hidden within the snow, though not of value for an Icefangs diet.</p>
            
                <h2>Hidden within the snow</h2>
                <p>The Icefangs fur takes on a light blue-ish hue. Hidden within the snow and caves to stay safe from potential other clans or even other subspecies if they somehow survive the cold. Their coat ranging only in dull to pastel colors to not become a target. To preserve heat in the cold their body temperature is way lower than that of mammals, this also giving them a slower metabolism. They are only 3 to 4.5 feet tall (0.9 to 1.4m) to use less energy. Their eyes have a reflecting membrane as a sort of second eye lid. With this they protect their eyes from snow and winds as well as reflect the sun away to not get blinded by it. This is also protecting them in snow storms. Their fur is thick and stores heat efficiently due to being double coated. Only parts sticking out of the coat are their appendages and hands. The appendages are made out of chitin to be sturdy yet preserve flexibility. Their hands are made out of a reptile like skin. Scales covering them to give a textured surface for grip strength. Their hind paws are huge and fur covered helping them stay on top of the snow. Due to evolution deeming the upper appendages unused the Icefangs only possess lower appendages to help them stay secure on the ground.</p>
            
                <h2>A new life is born</h2>
                <p>A new Icefang is created within the caverns of the Snowy Abyss. The colorful Crystals glowing dimly will grow into the form of a youngling over decades. Once completed a crystal falls to the ground. Once a year on Astras the sun is standing right to shine through the crystals. Bundling the light to one specific point on the ground. If the crystalized youngling lays there, they will melt out of the crystal. Slowly being able to move in the light before it once again disappears for another year. The coat color of the youngling will depend on the color of their birth crystal. They are able to survive on their own since day one but usually try to quickly find a clan.</p>

                <h2>Clans in the Snowy Abyss</h2>
                <p>Here the Clans are generally small to keep predators away and to have it easier finding food for the others. The clan size is between 3 and a max of 10 members.</p>

                <h2>The predators of the Snowy Abyss</h2>
                <h3>These are not open to make and will stay a closed part of Astras</h3>

                <h2>Never Safe...</h2>
                <p>While it may seem that there is not much life in the Snowy Abyss, some creatures still make it their home. Some are a food source for Arachs. For some, Arachs are the food source. Meet the <strong>Ice Ripper</strong>. A massive ball of fur and claws. With it's size of 6 foot it towers over the small Icefang arachs. All you can do here is hide. But be quiet.. Their massive ears will hear even the smallest noise, the 6 eyes watching everything. Those claws are not for fun either.</p>

                <h2>How do they survive?</h2>
                <p>Their fur keeps them warm while they also have a pretty low body temperature. While they move rather slowly most of the time, once food is near they can be fast. They are omnivores but focus on the protein and fat rich meat of arachs when they can. They will also rip off the bark of the Pervivanimus tree to eat the spongy inside. Their thick coat will save them from the pine needle like glass, but it still is not a pleasant feeling to get hit by.</p>

                <h2>Intelligence</h2>
                <p>They are smart in their own ways. A mix of bears and cats. They know how to solve problems and complex puzzles, yet are not intelligent enough to build houses or live in proper clans like Arachs do. They are loners in most cases and will react aggressively towards each other and other creatures.</p>

                <h1>Slimer | Glowing Bog</h1>
                <p class="region-intro">The Glowing Bog is a dark swampy area. Filled with deep murky waters, half dead tree roots and slightly and dimly glowing mushrooms. Unfriendly to unsuspecting visitors this area is rough to survive in, yet some species have managed to. Big predators that seem to be a mix of crocodile and jaguar made this their home. Arachs, only being unwanted visitors.</p>

                <h2>Food Sources</h2>
                <p>Arachs will hunt down other creatures if given the chance. Also fish and the mushrooms are a staple in their diet. On the rocks and branches a sweet moss can be found. It is rich in nutrients and abundant in most areas. Other than that the eggs of the predators are a delicacy, yet the price to get them is high.</p>

                <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
                <p>Arachs in this area are darker in color with different hues. Some of their markings emit a glow to blend in with the areas around them. Their eyes are a lighter color and glow as well. Their fur is more sleek similar to an otter to traverse quickly in the waters. Their tail is more flattened to act as a paddle in the water. Between their hands and paws you can find webbing to make swimming easier. They do not have appendages and only a fin on their back. Some Arachs will let moss and algae grow on their back to blend in with the environment.</p>

                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>These Arachs are created from a specific Mushroom. It is called Vireo Umbraferrens (eng. "Glowing Shade Bearer"). Arachs also call it the Dreadlight Spores. This mushroom when combined with soil and blood of a predator or the egg yolk of its eggs will create a new Arach. This process is rather dangerous for adult Arachs as getting the eggs or the blood requires skill and technique. Many younger adults will get themselves killed as they don't have the experience to do this safetly.</p>

                <h2>Clans</h2>
                <p>Clans in this area consist of 5 to 15 individuals. Usually on the smaller end of that span to be able to keep quiet and stay concealed.</p>

                <h1>Crushed Critters | The Wasteland</h1>
                <p class="region-intro">Despite being a mostly empty land, Arachs are able to live here as long as they are nomads. The temperatures fluctuate drastically between day and night going from 35°C at day to -15°C at night. Occasionally there are asteroid showers and impacts on the land. They leave a radioactive area around them but that will disappear within weeks. As it mostly is open land winds are very strong here and lead to a lot of flying dust.</p>

                <h2>Food Sources</h2>
                <p>Aside from some small plants that try to break through the soil there is not much to eat. Arachs will have to resort to killing other predators in this area (vulture like beasts). If that is not enough some individuals will resort to cannibalism.</p>
            
                <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
                <P>To help protect them from the bird like predators they have smaller spikes down their back. Most Arachs will develop a second pair of arms instead of having appendages. On their face they have little grooves from the top of their head to the edges of their mouth. On the very top of their head it is more plated than furred.</P>

                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>An Arach here is created when an asteroid hits the old remains of a dead Arachfara. Like a phoenix the youngling will rise from the ashes and dirt. The color of the asteroid as well as the colors of the dead Arachfara will determine the color of the youngling.</p>

                <h2>Clans</h2>
                <p>Clans are rather small with 3 to 10 individuals. Due to constantly being on the move they are simplistic and don't have agriculture or homes.</p>

                <h1>Burned Plate | Burning Isles</h1>
                <p class="region-intro">This is a volcanic Island full of canyons and fire. Surrounding it are smaller isles of similar size and temperature. Here basically everything is constantly burning. Due to the extreme heat no plants can be found here. Only pieces of what once was in form of fossilized remains or charcoal. On the surface many ores and materials can be found. Including sulfur, Iron and gold to name a few. The ground is a constant 60°C day and night. Closer to the volcanoes it is too hot to be touched by anything. The only habitable spot may be the ash fields though caution is required. All the ash in the air will damage the lung.</p>

                <h2>Food Sources</h2>
                <p>Due to food being a rarity in this area many Arachs resort to cannibalism. Some of the fossilized remains or plants may be edible though not recommended as it can cause lung and stomach issues. There are some smaller insects that made these islands their home though they are too small to be a constant food source.</p>
                
                <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
                <p>While younglings are born with fur, the adults are made of what seems to be plates. This happens as the heat slowly melts the dense fur together into a mass, only breaking at points that move like the joints. This way they are limited in mobility, but they are protected against some of the heat. Arachs in this region usually have no eyes as the eyeballs would melt inside their head due to heat. To protect against predators they posses back spines instead of their appendages. Usually they travel on all fours here to be faster in case of volcanic eruption. Their fur or plates usually are a brownish or reddish tone. Bright yellows and oranges are common as well to deter the flying predators in this region. To sense other living beings easier Arachs in this region posses 2 nostril pairs.</p>
                
                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>Arachs in this region are more like living corpses rather than new beings. Remains of what was are taken and buried in the ashy fields of this region. Once a sunflare hits or the volcano erupts the remains are melted together from the pile of ash, meat and organs. The new youngling looks mostly normal aside from some melted areas. They still have fur for the first few weeks until it melts together. Their blood and saliva aren't Black like other Arachs, but rather a bright glowing magma flowing out of open wounds constantly and always dripping out of their mouth seemingly out of control.</p>
                
                <h2>Clans</h2>
                <p>Due to their cannibalistic nature these Arachs are usually loners or only in pairs at most to hunt down others. The creation of new ones usually is as a food source but the younglings are often fast enough to burrow into the ash and ground underneath.</p>

                <h1>Spores | Evergreen Forest</h1>
                <p class="region-intro">The Evergreen Forest seems to be stuck in time. It's aura so captivating and hypnotizing. No matter the season or time of day, it always seem to be the same here. A warm spring day with 21°C, a warm shining sun through the tree crowns, light breeze and sweet smells of flowers and fruits. But don't be fooled. Once in this forest you cannot leave it anymore. It may seem safe at first but slowly over time you will lose your senses. You will lose your mind. The spores of the trees put you in a trance, slowly making you forget who you are. The creatures lurking in the dark, reeling you in with their thread. This is the perfect home for Arachfara.</p>

                <h2>Food Sources</h2>
                <p>Anything that wanders into this forest will be grabbed and ripped apart alive. The pollen of the Madshade Tree are hypnotizing the Arachs into doing anything that is against their nature. It seems that only Arachfara are this vulnerable to the pollen of the trees. Almost feral, they will attack anything that moves. Whether that be a little mouse like creature, a big tanky monster, or other members of their species. No matter what the case, they will eat it. There are many fruits and berries available but the Arachs here only eat meat and are strictly carnivorous.</p>
                
                <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
                <p>To blend in Arachs are mostly green or blue toned here. Whether that be light or dark, doesn't matter. Their appendages are longer and more sharp to help them tear and cut apart prey. Their eyes usually opened wide as to have the best chances to sense light and dark. They are on the smaller side but even faster than most Arachs in other regions. They are known to lay out silk as a form of tripwire. Before they are fully insane, they tend to be ambush predators but with time they will grow more mad and careless for their life.</p>
                
                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>Arachs in this forest are made from the resin of the Dendrosomnium Insaniae (eng. "Tree of Dreams and Madness") or also called the Madshade Tree. Once this blue glowing resin flows to the ground and hits a sapling or flower, a youngling will be created. They are already at a stage where they can protect themselves. At first they are still aware of their surroundings but with time they will go just as insane as the rest.</p>
                
                <h2>Clans</h2>
                <p>In the Evergreen Forest there are no clans due to the insane nature of the Arachs. Any intruder will be killed on sight.</p>

                <p class="region-intro">The Corrupted Caves connect to the Wasteland and are a labyrinth like cave system. The walls, floor and ceiling are covered in what seems to be glowing veins. The colors are usually a magenta, cyan or bright yellow but it can be any color. The place is very hostile and radioactive in nature. Anything that just spends minutes in these caves will die of radiation poisoning or at least become sick. Anything born here will be mutated.</p>

                <h2>Food Sources</h2>
                <p>Many of the creatures here are radioactive and will cause vomiting, bleeding and dehydration as well as burning away the throat. Arachs have adapted to this and will eat anything that they come across. Some will try to eat minerals and ores but those are instable and will decay once ripped out of the ground.</p>
                
                <h2>Visual Differences</h2>
                <p>The Arachfara in the Corrupted Caves are way larger than any other Arach. They can get upt to 16 feet tall (~5m) and are generally skinnier. Constantly on the hunt for food they look malnourished and every rib can be seen. Their appendages are out of control, often just waving around to a point the Arach will rip them out of their back on purpose. Their eyes are made for the dim light in the caves, but anything brighter than that will damage their eyes permanently.</p>
                
                <h2>Creation</h2>
                <p>In the caves flowers are growing. The pedals covered in the glowing veins of the caves. When a particle of dust or a drop of blood hits the center of the Flower there is a 3% chance that a new Arach will be created. The color of the blood and saliva of the Arach will correspond to the color of the veins in the flower.</p>
                
                <h2>Clans</h2>
                <p>No clans in this region.</p>
